!!! abstract "VMWare Workstation"

In our courses, desktop virtualization is done using VMWare Workstation or Microsoft Hyper-V. In these notes, I am looking at VMWare Workstation technology and we refer to these technologies as Virtual Machine Managers (VMMs). Your physical computer or laptop is referred to as the host computer. We will also refer to physical servers in the data center as hosts.

You need to develop a good skill level and familiarity and understand what you can and cannot do with Virtual Machines (VMs). You also need to understand snapshots, cloning and the VM network environment. The examples I give or details in my notes may be version specific and relate to a particular distro of Linux, it is your responsibility to ensure everything works. I don’t give step by step instructions for everything you have to do.

Figuring out how to do things is part of the exercise!
