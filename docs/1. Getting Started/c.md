# Scripting
Locate “Using VMware Workstation Pro” from the VMWare site. Find "Using the vmrun Command to Control Virtual Machines"
Run the command vmrun and document;
- Flags
- Power Commands
- Snapshot Commands
- Guest OS commands

Try some commands. Create a clone of a VM, start it, stop it and then delete it.

There is a newer tool available since Workstation 17.6, __vmcli__. Do some reading and see if that works. Give it a try and let me know how you got on.
