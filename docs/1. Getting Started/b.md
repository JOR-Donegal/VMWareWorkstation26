# First use
Before you start, find the documentation for the version of VMWare Workstation you are using, from the VMWare web site.

You can find a video where I walk through building a Linux VM [here](https://media.heanet.ie/page/e55bbad931f17c5b69199fb57fc01b70).

A video walk through demonstrating how to build a Windows 10 VM can be found here.

A video walk through demonstrating how to build a Windows 2016 VM can be found here.

I keep my VMs tidy on a per topic basis. For example, all my VMs for the module “NETW CP901 Enterprise and Data Center Networking” sit in a folder with the course code.

Create an appropriate folder for this module, keep VMs for this module in it.

## Exercise
Based on the video above

1. Create a VM called Ubuntu 24.04 Desktop.
2. Create a VM called Ubuntu 24.04 Server.
3. Update the descriptions in VMWare Workstation

Everything we do is based on the methodology Research then Do, then Test and Document.

What is an appropriate test to verify that you have completed the above work?
